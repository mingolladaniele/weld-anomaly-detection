# Industry 4.0: Can you Find the Anomalies?

The problem submitted to us by a large Italian automotive company concerns the identification of anomaly points within the curves generated by their welding processes. These welds were performed using spot methodology on chassis parts.
 
The goal of this project is to improve production efficiency and decrease the number of anomalies during the welding process. 

Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms and descriptive and inferential statistical analysis tools were used to achieve this goal
